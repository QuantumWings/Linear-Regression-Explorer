# Linear Regression Explorer

## Introduction
`Linear Regression Explorer` is an interactive tool designed to help users understand the basic concepts of linear regression. By adjusting parameters such as slope (a), noise (c), and sample size (n), users can instantly generate linear regression models and visualize their results. The tool has a modern design with a black and neon green theme.

Check out the demo [here](https://quantumwings.github.io/Linear-Regression-Explorer/).

## Main functions
- **Slope (a)**: Adjusts the slope of the linear regression model.
- **Noise (c)**: Adjust the amount of random noise for data points.
- **SampleNumber (n)**: Controls the number of data points generated.
- **Interactive chart**: Display data points and regression lines in real time, and add animation effects.

## Installation and Setup Guide

### Environmental requirements
- Web browser (latest version of Chrome, Firefox or Edge recommended)
- No need to install additional software or dependencies

### How to use
1. Download or copy the HTML file for this project and open it in your local environment.
2. Run the `index.html` file directly through the browser to start the application.

## Instructions for use

### Operation steps
1. After opening the `index.html` file, you will see an interface containing a control panel and charts.
2. Use the sliders to adjust the values ​​for `Slope (a)`, `Noise (c)` and `Number of Samples (n)`.
3. The chart will update in real time, showing the adjusted data points and corresponding regression lines.

### Example
- **Example input**:
 - `Slope(a)`: 2.0
 - `Noise (c)`: 3.0
 - `Number of samples (n)`: 500
- **Sample Output**:
 - Instantly generates a regression line with a slope of 2.0, with moderate random noise in the data points.
